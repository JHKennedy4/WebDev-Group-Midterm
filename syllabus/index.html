				<section>
					<p>
					  This course builds on the basic aspects of HTML, web design, and multimedia programming that are presented in 
					  741 (the prerequisite to this course). It provides an overview of web design concepts, including 
					  usability, accessibility, information design, and graphic design in the context of the web. It also provides an 
					  introduction to important and emerging web site technologies.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
					  <strong>Important note regarding prerequisite knowledge</strong>: I will expect that you have a solid base of prior 
					  knowledge about basic HTML and CSS coding and the use of UNIX in a command-line environment. You should 
					  be familiar with basic HTML and CSS coding (using text editors), use of Photoshop (or other graphic editor), and basic 
					  design principles for the web, as well as UNIX commands for creating, deleting, renaming, and changing permissions 
					  for files and directories. I recommend the Visual Quickstart books on HTML and UNIX as a good reference for 
					  these topics, along with the Non-Designer's Web Book. In addition, in this course I assume 
					  that you have basic programming skills -- the particular language is not important, but an understanding of 
					  programming concepts is important.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
					  Students are expected to use valid and well-formed XHTML 1.0 (Strict) and CSS (Level 2) for all work in this 
					  course. Some work with HTML5 APIs, tags, attributes, and ideas and some work with CSS3 will be encountered by 
					  students taking this course. All coding must be done &quot;by hand&quot; within a text or programmers&apos; 
					  editor. Do not use Dreamweaver&#174; or other such drag-and-drop editors, as they conceal too much 
					  of the code for our purposes.
					</p>

					<h2>Final Grades</h2>
					<p>
					  A final letter grade will be assigned from points that you have accumulated (e.g. A = 90-100%, B = 80-90%, etc.). 
					  <strong>I do not grade on a curve</strong>, so if every student does "A" work, then every student gets an "A"
					  (or a "D", as the case may be...).
					</p>
					<p>
					  It is important to understand that if you complete all the requirements for an assignment, that is only sufficient 
					  for a grade of "C" (i.e. "satisfactory work"). To receive an "A" for an assignment, you must go beyond the basic 
					  requirements, and show creativity, initiative, and <em>excellence</em>. The grade of "A" is intended for work that is 
					  clearly superior, rather than average.
					</p>
					<h2>Late Assignments</h2>
					<p>
					  Assignments submitted after the due date/time, without prior approval from me, will lose 50% for each day that 
					  they are late. If you know that a situation will prevent you from turning something in, contact me <em>in advance</em> of 
					  the deadline to make alternate arrangements.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h2>The Practical Exam</h2>
					<p>
					  All the projects you do for this class are significant enough that they are completed outside of class time. 
					  Amongst other things, the practical examination at the end of the term is designed to show us that you 
					  personally can do minimally competent work in creating a page using XHTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. By 
					  <em>&quot;minimally competent&quot;</em> I mean: (1) the code is valid &amp; well-formed, (2) the 
					  CSS does what it is supposed to do to the browser display, and (3) the JavaScript adds the functionality it is 
					  supposed to add to the page. This is not a hard test, but you will &quot;fail&quot; the practical examination 
					  if any one of these three minimal expectations is completely missing or seriously flawed in execution.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Coding Standards</h2>
					<p>
					  Like any other IT course, 409/737 has simple coding standards. We practice using the <em>Model-View-Controller</em> 
					  paradigm here, so all XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be maintained in seperate files, All pages must be constructed of 
					  <em>valid &amp; well-formed</em> (I will use the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" 
					  title="visit the site for W3C validators">W3C validation services</a> to check) XHTML and CSS, and of JavaScript. 
					  The XHTML must just be XHTML, no embedded or inline CSS or JavaScript or style attributes or such. The CSS 
					  must actually do what the assignment says it is supposed to do, and the JavaScript must actually add the functionality 
					  the assignment calls for. No matter how pretty your code, it must actually do what the assignment calls for. 
					  All resources must be kept on RIT servers, unless you get prior permission from the instructor.
					</p>
					<p>
					  The code required of you for this class is cross-platform &amp; cross-browser XHTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. 
					  This is not a server-side class, although you will be exposed to PHP and other server-side technologies. Focus on 
					  writing cross-platform &amp; cross-browser XHTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript code. 
					</p>

					<h2>Grade Disputes</h2>
					<p>
					  If you wish to dispute your final course grade, you must do so before the end of the quarter following this one; 
					  after that, documentation of your work may be discarded.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Attribution &amp; Academic Honesty</h2>
					<p>
					  <strong>Each student must write their own code, or include clear attribution statements in the source file(s) and in 
					  writeup(s) if they use or modify code created by someone else. <em>Failure to give proper attribution will result in 
					  a grade of "F" on that assignment, and may be treated as a case of academic dishonesty.</em></strong>
					</p>
				</section>

			<h2 class="toggleable">Examinations &amp; Tests</h2>
			<article>
				<section>
					<h2>Written Exams</h2>
					<p>There are NO written exams in this class.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Practical Exams</h2>
					<p>
					  The practical exam is to test your personal mastery of the technical skills covered in the class. 
					  You will have to complete specific tasks in a constrained time period. You will be able to use textbooks 
					  and Websites, but not study guides, written notes, or files brought on disk. You will not be allowed to 
					  copy source code from existing web sites. No cutting and pasting from <em>anywhere</em>, please.</p>
					<p>The practical is worth 20% of your grade and will be given the first class meeting of week 10.</p>

			<h2 class="toggleable">Enrollment and Grading Issues</h2>
			<article>
				<section>
					<h2>Last day to drop</h2>
					<p>
					  For this quarter, you can add/drop a class on or before <strong>&lt;&lt;must look this up&gt;&gt;</strong>. After that date, 
					  you must withdraw from the course, which will show on your transcript as a "W".
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Last day to withdraw</h2>
					<p>
					  The deadline for withdrawing from a course with a "W" grade is <strong>&lt;&lt;must look this up&gt;&gt;</strong>. Forms may 
					  be obtained from the IT office, and must be signed by your instructor. Completed forms should be returned 
					  to the IT office no later than <strong>&lt;&lt;must look this up&gt;&gt;</strong>. After that date, a grade will be assigned based 
					  on the work that you have submitted.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Incomplete grades</h2>
					<h3>Requesting</h3>
					<p>
					  You may request an incomplete (a grade of "I") only in cases where exceptional conditions beyond your control, 
					  such as accidents, severe illness, family problems, etc., have kept you from completing the course. <em>You 
					  must alert us to these circumstances as soon as possible</em>. Telling your instructor in February that you 
					  were sick in December is not acceptable.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Incomplete grades are not given to students who have simply fallen behind in their work</strong>.</p>
					<h3>Completing</h3>
					<p>
					  If your request is granted, then you must complete the work for the course within the time limits set by the instructor. 
					  <em>The maximum time to complete a grade of "I" is two (2) academic quarters. After that time, grades of "I" automatically 
					  become grades of "F"</em>.
					</p>
				</section>
			</article>
			<h2 class="toggleable">Attendance &amp; Participation</h2>
			<article>
				<section>
					<h2>Classes</h2>
					<p>
					  You are expected to attend every class. Missing just one class means you've missed a half week 
					  of material, which is 5% of the material for the entire quarter. If you absolutely must miss 
					  a class, it is your responsibility to find out what materials you've missed and to do the readings 
					  &amp; exercises associated with that class.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Participation</h2>
					<p>
					  Participation is more than simply showing up, however. I expect you to be an active participant in 
					  the learning process. That means asking questions when you don't understand a concept, helping 
					  others if you finish your work quickly, and being actively engaged in the class.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>In-Class Exercises</h2>
					<p>
					  Each class meeting will include one or more exercises and/or lab time. These may be any of a variety 
					  of activities from group discussion &amp; planning to step-by-step problem solving exercises. From time to 
					  time your in-class work will be checked, and this will figure into your participation grade for the quarter.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Study Guides/Homeworks</h2>
					<p>
					  When I assign additional out-of-class materials, these materials may include study guides, tutorials, 
					  and questions and answers or small tests. They will always be due at the beginning of the next class. 
					  Your completion of this material will also figure into your grade for the quarter.
					</p>
				</section>
			</article>
			<h2 class="toggleable">Textbooks, Readings, &amp; Materials</h2>
			<article>
				<section>
					<h2>Books</h2>
					<p>The latest editions as well as used copies of the following texts should be available at the bookstore:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><em>Webmaster in a Nutshell</em></li>
					  <li><em>Information Architecture</em></li>
					</ul>
					<p>These texts are recommended as probably being useful for you long after you take the course.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Readings</h2>
					<p>
					  In addition to the texts, online readings will be assigned and linked from this course Website. Other reading 
					  assignments may be provided or assigned as appropriate.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Materials</h2>
					<p>You should purchase and use blank CDs or DVDs or other robust media to save your work.</p>

			<h2 class="toggleable">Computer Accounts</h2>
			<article>
				<section>
					<h2>DCE Account</h2>
					<p>
					  Your DCE ID and password actually gives you access to multiple systems here at RIT. In this class, 
					  you'll need a DCE account in order to access "Gibson," RIT's UNIX system that will store your WWW 
					  pages. You'll also need it to access RIT's webmail service. You probably already have this account, 
					  but if you don't (of if you have problems with it), bring your student ID to the 
					  <a href="http://www.rit.edu/its/help/">ITS Help Desk</a> to get your DCE account set up.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>NT Account</h2>
					<p>
					  You should get an NT account if you ever wish to work on any Mac or PC in any IT lab.
					  The NT accounts are set up by the staff in the main IT lab. You will need your student ID and your printed 
					  schedule (to prove that you are enrolled in an IT class). Check ahead to find out when you can have your account(s) 
					  set up; not all lab assistants have the authority to make the accounts.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Institute Policy</h2>
					<p>RIT has a specific policy dealing with academic dishonesty., which is available online at:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><a href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/Manual/sectionD/D8.html">RIT Academic Honesty Policy</a></li>

					<h2>Department Policy</h2>
					<p>
					  The Information Technology Department also has a specific policy dealing with academic dishonesty, which is also 
					  available online at:
					</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><a href="http://www.ist.rit.edu/?q=node/108">IT Department Academic Honesty Policy</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					  It is extremely important that you understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. <strong>Please 
					  read the RIT &amp; IT Department Academic Honesty Policies</strong>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
					<p>
					  Some students are not familiar with the requirements of documentation in writing, and with the difference 
					  between <em>appropriate use of sources</em> and <em>plagiarism</em>. The following sites provide excellent 
					  examples of how and when to document your sources. <em>Please review these sites before turning in your first 
					  assignment</em>:
